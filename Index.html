            <p>The article highlights the widespread impact of AI on society, particularly in medicine and scientific research. As AI becomes integral in data-driven decision-making, researchers and ethicists are examining its ethical implications. Notable figures like Elisa Hurley and Jon Herington discuss the importance of "data ethics," emphasizing fair, representative data and avoiding exploitation in research, especially when it involves diverse populations. 

                The growing reliance on AI brings ethical dilemmas, such as privacy concerns and "blurring lines" between personal data and research data. AI’s reliance on vast amounts of de-identified data, often managed by private companies, raises questions about accountability and oversight, as much of this data lacks regulation.
                
                PRIM&R, a research ethics organization, leads discussions on responsible AI, hosting workshops funded by NSF to explore ethical frameworks and address the risks AI poses to research ethics. Participants at these events, including experts from various institutions, tackle challenges like AI in clinical decision support, violence prevention, and the ethical involvement of diverse populations.
                
                With public concern on the rise, the article underscores the need for ethical AI practices, the role of IRBs, and a proactive approach to ensure that AI-driven research respects human rights and remains transparent. PRIM&R aims to uphold ethical standards in AI's evolving role in research.</p>
